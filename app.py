        You are a fact-checking AI. Analyze the following text/article for credibility:

        "{text}"

        Tasks:
        1. Assign a credibility score (0â€“100).
        2. Classify as one of: Real, Fake, Misleading, Uncertain, or Humor/Meme.
        3. Explain WHY in a structured way:
           - Evidence (or lack of it)
           - Sources (are any cited? are they credible?)
           - Tone (neutral, sensational, conspiratorial, etc.)
           - Factual Reliability (consistent with known facts or not)
           - Extraordinary Claims (unsupported or backed up)
        4. Keep explanation concise but detailed enough to justify the score.
